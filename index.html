        <h2>What is a Kei Car?</h2>
        <p>
          A kei car is a small, fuel-efficient vehicle designed specifically for
          the Japanese market. They are known for their compact size, low
          emissions, and affordable prices. Kei cars typically have a maximum
          engine displacement of 660cc and adhere to strict government
          regulations regarding dimensions and weight.

        <h2>How much do they cost?</h2>
        <p>
          Kei cars are generally more affordable than larger vehicles, making
          them a popular choice for budget-conscious drivers. The cost of a Kei
          car can vary depending on factors such as the model, year, mileage,
          and condition. While Kei cars offer excellent value for money, it's
          important to consider long-term costs, including maintenance, fuel
          consumption, and potential resale value
